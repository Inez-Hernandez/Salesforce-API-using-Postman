# Salesforce-API-using-Postman

Created these REST API calls within Postman using Tests and Pre-requests to iterate through an array of data that was first converted to a string, passed into an environment variable, then parsed back into an array as environment variables in Postman cannot be array objects.

Code bits have been sanitized to remove identifiable information.

Repo does not include the Authentication POST requests using OAuth.

Code written by me.
